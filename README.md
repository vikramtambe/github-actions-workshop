## Overview

Welcome to the **GitHub Actions Workshop**! This interactive workshop is designed to help you learn, practice, and master GitHub Actions—GitHub's powerful automation platform for building, testing, and deploying code.

Throughout this workshop, you'll gain hands-on experience in:

- Automating workflows to streamline your development process.
- Running tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
- Deploying applications efficiently to various environments.
- Leveraging GitHub Actions to integrate with third-party services and tools.

The workshop is structured around a series of labs, exercises, and real-world example workflows. Each lab is crafted to incrementally build your knowledge and skills, making it accessible whether you're a beginner exploring automation for the first time or an experienced developer looking to optimize and scale your CI/CD pipelines.

By the end of this workshop, you'll have the tools and confidence to harness the full potential of GitHub Actions, enabling you to automate complex processes, improve productivity, and accelerate software delivery.

### Accounts and Tools

- **Cloud Service Accounts** _(Optional, based on workshop goals)_:
  - Accounts on services like **Azure**, **AWS**, or **Google Cloud Platform** may be needed if the workshop includes deployment exercises.
- **Docker Hub Account** _(Optional)_:
  - Required if you plan to build and push custom Docker actions to a container registry.

### Software Tools

- **GitHub CLI** _(Optional)_:
  - Install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) for certain exercises involving automation with the CLI.
- **Docker** _(Optional)_:
  - Install Docker if working on custom Docker-based actions. Refer to the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
